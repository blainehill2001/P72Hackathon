## Backend

The backend is built using Flask, exposing an API which will perform the logic of Itinerfy.

It is deployed on [Render](https://render.com/) and we tested it using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

The advantage of Render is that it handles all of the load balancing and autodeployment (among other CI/CD pipeline attributes).
