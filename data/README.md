For simplicity and demonstration purposes, we focus on a chosen area within Manhattan (rather than the whole subway and the whole New York area).

We choose this area based on a few criteria:
1. It contains enough tourist attractions to demonstrate tour planning across different places.
2. It contains enough subway routes. There are a few different subway routes to consider going from one place to another. We can demonstrate tour planning under certain objectives (shortest walking distance, shortest traveling time, etc.)

We choose this area to cover from E/W 4 St to 53 St, and 1 Av to 11 Av.

We take Washington Square Park as the starting point of the user. There are three different subway stations and 13 different subway lines to choose from surrounding Washington Square Park to start with.

attractions.py generates the attractions_data.csv. It contains the real Latitude and Longitude of the corresponding tourist attractions.

subways.py generates the subways_data.csv. It contains the real Latitude and Longitude of the corresponding subway stations, as well as the actual subway lines available at each station.

We used data from Google Maps and MTA.
