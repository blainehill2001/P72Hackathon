# Trip Itinerary Scheduler

This project is a trip itinerary scheduler designed to optimize both cost and time for travelers using a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm. The scheduler takes into account various factors such as transportation costs, travel time, and preferences set by the user to generate an efficient travel plan.

## Features

- **Optimized Itinerary**: Utilizes a Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm to generate an optimized itinerary that minimizes both cost and travel time.
- **Customizable Preferences**: Allows users to set preferences such as preferred modes of transportation, maximum travel time, budget constraints, and must-visit destinations.
- **Real-time Updates**: Integrates with transit authority APIs or third-party transit apps to provide real-time updates on transportation schedules, delays, and service statuses.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/blainehill2001/P72Hackathon.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd P72Hackathon
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the application:

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

## Usage

1. Launch the application by running `app.py`.
  
2. Input your travel details including starting location, destination, travel dates, and any preferences or constraints you have.
  
3. The scheduler will then generate an optimized itinerary based on the input provided.
  
4. Review the itinerary and make any necessary adjustments.
  
5. Save or export the finalized itinerary for your reference.
