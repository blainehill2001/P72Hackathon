# Trip Itinerary Scheduler

This project is a trip itinerary scheduler designed to optimize both cost and time for travelers using a Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) algorithm. The scheduler takes into account various factors such as transportation costs, travel time, and preferences set by the user to generate an efficient travel plan.

## Features

- **Optimized Itinerary**: Utilizes a Minimum Spanning Tree algorithm to generate an optimized itinerary that minimizes both cost and travel time.
- **Customizable Preferences**: Allows users to set preferences such as preferred modes of transportation, maximum travel time, budget constraints, and must-visit destinations.
- **Real-time Updates**: Integrates with transit authority APIs or third-party transit apps to provide real-time updates on transportation schedules, delays, and service statuses.
